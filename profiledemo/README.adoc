== About

This is a simple demo about the new
profile mechanism in spring boot 3.

In spring boot 2 it was possible to
include different profiles by one profile.

In spring boot 3 we have still this option,
but we have to introduce groups instead
of using includes.

== Setup

Inside the default profile we define
following profile groups:

[ditaa]
----

/------\
| dev  | ------> localserver, h2
\------/

/------\
| prod | ------> prodserver, postgres, real_products 
\------/

---- 

And we have the files:

----
application.yml
application-h2.yml
application-localserver.yml
application-mocked_products.yml
application-postgres.yml
application-prodserver.yml
application-real_products.yml
----

where we define some variables which are
simply printed out by the demo application.


== How to use

=== Use without profile setting:

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun
----

[source, bash]
----
____________________________________________________________
Currently Spring Profiles active:
____________________________________________________________

Leads to situation:
-server:default-value
-database:default-value
-products:default-value

----


=== Use with active profile "prod"
[source, bash]
----
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
./gradlew bootRun
----

leads to

[source, bash]
----
____________________________________________________________
Currently Spring Profiles active:prod
____________________________________________________________

Leads to situation:
-server:prodserver
-database:postgres
-products:real products

----


=== Use with active profile "dev"
[source, bash]
----
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev
./gradlew bootRun
----

leads to

[source, bash]
----
____________________________________________________________
Currently Spring Profiles active:dev
____________________________________________________________

Leads to situation:
-server:localserver
-database:h2
-products:default-value

----

=== Use with active profile "dev,mocked_products"
[source, bash]
----
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev,mocked_products
./gradlew bootRun
----

leads to

[source, bash]
----
____________________________________________________________
Currently Spring Profiles active:dev,mocked_products
____________________________________________________________

Leads to situation:
-server:localserver
-database:h2
-products:mocked products
